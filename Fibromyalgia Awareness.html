    <h2>What is Fibromyalgia?</h2>
    <p>Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by widespread pain, fatigue, and other symptoms such as sleep disturbances and cognitive difficulties. It often affects how the brain processes pain signals, leading to increased sensitivity.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Hidden Disabilities</h2>
    <p>Fibromyalgia is considered a hidden disability because its symptoms are not always visible to others. Those living with fibromyalgia may face challenges in daily activities and work, even when they appear healthy on the outside.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Types of Fibromyalgia</h2>
    <p>There are several types of fibromyalgia, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary Fibromyalgia:</strong> The most common form, typically diagnosed in adults.</li>
        <li><strong>Fibromyalgia with Other Conditions:</strong> Often coexists with other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.</li>
        <li><strong>Pediatric Fibromyalgia:</strong> Affects children and adolescents, like in my case as a 17-year-old diagnosed after suffering since childhood.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Living with Fibromyalgia</h2>
    <p>Managing fibromyalgia often requires a holistic approach, including medication, physical therapy, and lifestyle changes. Support from family, friends, and support groups can also be invaluable.</p>
